# Introduction to Engineering Research - Fernando Corte Vargas

This repostory includes the scripts where I performed the data analysis for my IER assignment.

## Installation

For this repository, you will have to have Python and Anaconda Installed. Please make sure you also have Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, and Plotnine installed in your base installation of Anaconda so that the script can still run smoothly.

For this, you can run on the terminal of your computer. The versions used are all the latest releases (dated 7 June 2022). Compatibility issues are not expected with older versions of this software. 

```
conda install [package name]
